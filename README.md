Demo available at: https://context.emmasandbox.com

## Instructions

- [X] Create a ThemeContext component to handle the themes for your application components (Buttons, Containers ....) at least with Day/Night.
- [X] Create different styles for all your components to support the current theme
- [X] Create LoginContext component to handle a user login information ({username: "test" , password: "12345" , isLoggedIn: true/false}) by default the user will be logged in.
- [X] Create a component to handle the common login actions using a button with changing session functionality (isLoggedIn:true/false) true = show the user information, false = message to login again. No Form needed
- [X] Create a UsersContext component to handle users information (attached users.js file)
- [X] Based on UsersContext create a component to render all users in a list (use a card component for each user).
- [X] Add a delete button to the user card component and show it only if the current user is logged in,  add the implementation to delete the user when this button is pressed and visible.

Feel free to add more complexity. Have fun!
